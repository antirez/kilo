- long lines with tabs in them aren't correctly rendered when editing the part
  outside of the boundaries of the editor windows (i.e. when scrolled to the right.)
  a patch of dirkf exists, however it's way too intrusive, and actually doesn't even
  work correctly.
- if cursor is moved outside the visible bounds of a long line, the new code
  to optimize screen redraw doesn't properly detect that the screen needs redraw
